# AP-CS-Classwork1
My Christmas classwork for Mr.Daniel's AP Computer Science class.
This program is a simulation of a game inspired from the game â€œSleeping Dogs."
It is hard to explain the mechanism of the game in word so I append a link of video which domonstrate how it work in that game to help you better understand this program: https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EnG7jxtJn6o

# AP-CS-Classwork1
My winter holiday project assignment for Mr.Daniel's AP Computer Science class
This project is made by William and me.
This project is a testing vocabulary size program. This program will ask the user some questions about the meaning of typical words. There will be about 30 multiple choice questions, asking the synonym, antonym, and the definition of a word.
